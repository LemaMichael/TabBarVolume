Replace the volume popup with a more subtle way to display the volume when the user changes it with the volume rocker.

# Why and how
The iOS default popover showing the volume status that appears when the user clicks the volume rocker is a big obtrusive glossy view that covers the content shown. This library offers a way to show a more subtle indicator.  
To make sure that the popover is not shown there are two conditions that need to be satisfied:  
- An `AVAudioSession` needs to be active
- An `MPVolumeView` needs to be in the current view's hierarchy, and its alpha needs to be greater than 0

Once a `SubtleVolume` is added to your view, an audio session is automatically started, and the view's alpha is set to `0.0001` in the hidden state.

# Getting Started
Create an instance of `SubtleVolume` with one of its convenience initializers, and set its position (you can either set the frame or let autolayout handle it):
```swift
let volume = SubtleVolume(style: .plain)
volume.frame = CGRect(x: 0, y: 10, width: UIScreen.main.bounds.width, height: 4) // or wherever you like
```

Set the barTintColor property:
```swift
volume.barTintColor = .red
```

Set the animation type if needed (no animation will result in the indicator being always visible):
```swift
volume.animation = .slideDown
```

Add the view to your hierarchy:
```swift
view.addSubview(volume)
```

To change the volume programmatically:
```swift
try? volume.setVolumeLevel(0.5)
```

Or use the convenience methods:
```swift
try? volume.decreaseVolume(by: 0.2, animated: true)
try? volume.increaseVolume(by: 0.2, animated: true)
```

### Accessory image
You can provide an accessory image that will be shown to the bar's left. See the delegate method:
```swift
func subtleVolume(_ subtleVolume: SubtleVolume, accessoryFor value: Double) -> UIImage? {
  return value > 0 ? #imageLiteral(resourceName: "volume-on.pdf") : #imageLiteral(resourceName: "volume-off.pdf")
}
```

### iPhone X(S/R) support
Want to be fancy and show the volume bar in the notch area? Check out the demo project. The main gist is this:

```swift
class ViewController: UIViewController {
  let volume = SubtleVolume(style: .rounded)
  var statusBarVisible = true

  // ...

  override func viewDidLayoutSubviews() {
    super.viewDidLayoutSubviews()

    if view.safeAreaInsets.top > 0 {
      volume.padding = CGSize(width: 2, height: 8)
      volume.frame = CGRect(x: 16, y: 8, width: 60, height: 20)
    } else {
      // older phones here
    }
  }

  override var preferredStatusBarStyle: UIStatusBarStyle {
    return .lightContent
  }

  override var preferredStatusBarUpdateAnimation: UIStatusBarAnimation {
    return .slide
  }

  override var prefersStatusBarHidden: Bool {
    return !statusBarVisible
  }
}

extension ViewController: SubtleVolumeDelegate {
  func subtleVolume(_ subtleVolume: SubtleVolume, didChange value: Double) {
    if !subtleVolume.isAnimating && view.safeAreaInsets.top > 0 {
      statusBarVisible = true
      UIView.animate(withDuration: 0.1) {
        self.setNeedsStatusBarAppearanceUpdate()
      }
    }
  }

  func subtleVolume(_ subtleVolume: SubtleVolume, willChange value: Double) {
    if !subtleVolume.isAnimating && view.safeAreaInsets.top > 0 {
      statusBarVisible = false
      UIView.animate(withDuration: 0.1) {
        self.setNeedsStatusBarAppearanceUpdate()
      }
    }
  }
}
```


# Handle the background state

Once your app goes in background, you'll need to resume the session when it becomes active:

```swift
NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(volume, selector: #selector(SubtleVolume.resume), name: NSNotification.Name.UIApplicationDidBecomeActive, object: nil)
```

SubtleVolume automatically removes the observer on deinit.
